From April 2020, all MOE schools will implement one day of Home-Based Learning (HBL) a week. This will help us prepare for an extended period of HBL should the need arise, so that our students can continue with their learning. Our school will be conducting HBL on Wednesdays, starting from 1 Apr 2020 (Wed).&nbsp; The HBL schedule and plan will be sent to all parents on Tue, 31 Mar 2020.
