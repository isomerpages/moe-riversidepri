**2025 Primary One Orientation**

Dear Parent of P1 (2025) Students,

Thank you for making Riverside Primary School the choice school for your child! We warmly welcome you and your child to the Riverside family! We look forward to working in partnership with you to provide a quality school experience for your child and develop him/her holistically.

The Primary 1 (P1) Orientation for 2025 P1 Cohort will be held in the school on Thursday, 14 November 2024 from 2.00pm to 4.00pm.&nbsp; We would like to encourage parents to attend the orientation with your 2025 P1 child. At the orientation, there will be a briefing for parents and classroom activities for your 2025 P1 child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

More details of the Orientation Programme will be emailed out to you by end of Oct 2024

Thank you.
