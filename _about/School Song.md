### **Riverside Primary School Song**

Riverside is where we learn  
and grow with one another  
Riverside is where we shine  
brighter with each day

We will do our best together,  
trying, thinking, working hard  
With determination  
making proud our Riverside

Riverians are who we are  
sparkling with character,  
Riverians are who we are  
leading with our hearts

We will be the best we can  
always doing what is right  
Loving, caring for everyone  
making proud our Riverside

Riverside in Singapore  
working in community  
Riverside in the world  
always giving back

We will give our best together  
make our world a better place  
Standing tall with our heads high  
Making proud our Riverside  
Making proud our Riverside
