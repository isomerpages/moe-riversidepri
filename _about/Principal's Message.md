**_Learning Together, Growing Together, Sparkling Together_**

At the heart of Riverside Primary School lies a simple yet powerful belief: every child possesses unique potential waiting to be discovered and nurtured. As educators, we are privileged to guide our Riverians on their transformative educational journey, inspiring joy in learning and fostering an environment where curiosity thrives.

Our approach to education is holistic and forward-looking. We seamlessly integrate Educational Technology (EdTech) to create dynamic, interactive learning experiences that empower our students to take ownership of their educational journey. Through Assessment for Learning (AfL), we cultivate reflective learners who understand their strengths and embrace areas for growth, developing resilience and confidence along the way.

At Riverside Primary, education extends beyond academic excellence. We focus on developing well-rounded individuals through our comprehensive Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programmes and emphasis on 21st Century Competencies (21CC). Our SPARKLE Values guide Riverians in becoming responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to Singapore's future.

Our school is more than an institution of learning—it is a vibrant community where students, parents, and teachers collaborate to create an inclusive and nurturing environment. This partnership is fundamental to our success in bringing out the best in each Riverian.

Our motto, "Learning Together, Growing Together, Sparkling Together," reflects our commitment to igniting a lifelong passion for learning while building our students' confidence and character. It embodies our vision: "The Best from Each, A Better Future for All."

Together, we will continue to work hand in hand with our parents and community to prepare our Riverians not just for academic success, but for life itself—equipping them with the knowledge, skills, and values to thrive in an ever-evolving world.
