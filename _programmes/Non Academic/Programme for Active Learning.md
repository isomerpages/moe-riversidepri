The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) emphasizes whole-child development, providing all pupils with broad exposure and progressive experiences in Learning Enrichment, Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts and Design Education, and Performing Arts. Through PAL, pupils will discover new interests, learn new skills and nurture Confidence, Curiosity, Creativity and Cooperation.

The PAL modules provide opportunities for pupils to develop character and citizenship, anchored by the SPARKLE Values, Social-Emotional Competencies and 21st Century Competencies (Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills; Information and Communication Skills; and Critical and Inventive Thinking).
