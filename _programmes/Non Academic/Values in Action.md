## Values in Action


Values in Action (VIA) at Riverside Primary School aims to develop our students as Connected Citizens of Good Character who are concerned citizens, active contributors and service leaders. They are heads-on, hearts-on and hands-on in their contributions to society.

VIA activities are planned according to 3 main themes and carried out school-wide as well as for specific groups. The 3 main themes are:  
(P1 and P2) Care for Self and the School  
(P3 and P4) Care for the Community  
(P5 and P6) Care for the Nation
