## Values in Action


<p>Values in Action (VIA) at Riverside Primary School aims to develop our students as Connected Citizens of Good Character who are concerned citizens, active contributors and service leaders. They are heads-on, hearts-on and hands-on in their contributions to society.</p><br>

<p>VIA activities are planned according to 3 main themes and carried out school-wide as well as for specific groups. The 3 main themes are:  
(P1 and P2) Care for Self and the School  
(P3 and P4) Care for the Community  
(P5 and P6) Care for the Nation</p><br>

<p>Caring for plants, trees and the environment nurtures in our pupils <b>A</b>wareness of community and environment concerns, fosters an<b>A</b>ffiliation with the community and natural environment and calls them to <b>A</b>ction to shape a green and healthy environment for all. Our pupils are actively involved in caring for the plants that are allocated to their classes. They are tasked to monitor the growth of the plants as well as nurture them by watering and caring for them daily. Through the gardening process, pupils fully appreciate the 3Ps for a Sustainable Future...

<p>R3 is a VIA Project which our Primary 2 to Primary 5 pupils are required to do during the school holiday. Our pupils make use of Playwork Protocol and recycled materials to create items based on the themes provided. In 2020, the CCE June Holiday Project is in line with the theme for National Day, “Together A Stronger Singapore”, is a rallying call to Singaporeans to play our part to push forward and determine Singapore’s future, in spite of the difficulties and crises.  We want to emerge from the crisis stronger as a nation, with our best days ahead of us. For Singapore to emerge stronger, all occupations have a part to play.

Our students used recyclable materials to design and build a model associated with an occupation using recyclable materials.</p>
