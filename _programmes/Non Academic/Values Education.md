<p>Values inculcation is important as we want our students to be anchored with sound values, have a strong sense of what is right and wrong, have the courage to take responsibility for their own choices and actions. We want our students to possess the right attitude which will help them attain their life goals and succeed in life.</p>

<p>Values lessons were conducted in the classroom. Beyond classroom learning, we provide opportunities for students to reflect and apply their learning in authentic day-to-day life experiences. Interesting recess activities were also carried out to help students to reinforce and&nbsp; internalise the SPARKLE values learnt.</p>

<div><ul><li>
<p>Being Kind to one another helps to improve relationships, makes one feel more appreciative and Form Teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their young charges. The Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) enables Form Teachers to better cater to each pupil’s holistic development (especially their Social and Emotional Learning) and build closer teacher-pupil rapport.</p>
<p>The Social-Emotional Competencies we seek to develop in every child are as follows:
</p><p><b>Self-Awareness</b> Your child has self-awareness if he/she understands his/her own emotions, strengths, inclinations and weaknesses.
<br><b>Self-Management</b> Your child can manage himself/herself effectively if he/she has the capacity to manage his/her own emotions. He/She should be self-motivated, exercise discipline and display strong goal-setting and organizational skills.
<br><b>Social Awareness</b> Your child has social awareness if he/she has the ability to accurately discern different perspectives, recognize and appreciate diversity, empathize with and respect others.
<br><b>Relationship Management</b>
Your child can manage relationships effectively if he/she has the ability to establish and maintain healthy and rewarding relationships through effective communication, and is able to work with others to resolve issues and provide assistance.
<br><b>Responsible Decision-Making</b> Your child can make responsible decisions if he/she has the capacity to identify and analyze a situation competently. He/She should be able to reflect upon the implications of decisions made, based on personal, moral and ethical considerations.
