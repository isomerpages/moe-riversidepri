			<h5>Riverside Primary Curriculum</h5><br>
			<u><b>Our Beliefs</b></u><br>
We believe that Art allows students to stay connected with their surroundings by providing them opportunities to communicate their ideas, thoughts and feelings and express themselves through creating and making. <br>

<u><b>Objectives of Art Curriculum</b></u><br>
The objectives of our six-year art curriculum are as follows:
<br>- Enjoy and appreciate art of local and global cultures.
<br>- Discuss artworks using basic art vocabulary.
<br>- Explore the various uses of different art media and techniques through art-making.
<br>- Apply appropriate processes, techniques and materials into their artworks.
<br>- Discuss intentions of their artworks and interpret other artworks.<br>

<br>In Riverside, teachers engage students in positive and safe learning experiences where they develop sensory awareness, imagination and visual inquiry skills to discover and explore their surroundings. Students are also engaged in art discussions, using See, Think, Wonder at lower primary and Feldman Approach at upper primary, which allows them to describe and interpret artworks with appropriate art terms.<br>
<br>The school’s curriculum provides students with insights on Elements of Art, Principles of Design, Art Forms, Art Techniques and Art Values. Students are also introduced to different types of materials, as well as iPad applications, where they get to explore and experiment with a variety of mediums to create artworks.</td><td background= "/images/canvas_about1.jpg"></td>

	</td><td>Art helps us to see in new ways<br>
<br>Art represents experiences and ideas using materials, tools and visual elements such as shapes, colours, and forms. As a predominantly visual language that communicates and represents the world through images, art provides alternative ways to understand the world and our experiences in it. In art, students learn how to experiment with and use different media, tools and visual qualities, with reference to how artists use these in their work. This equips students to communicate in innovative visual ways so as to bring attention to their ideas or change how people see things.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Art tells stories about our world<br>
Throughout history, art documents events, experiences, and how people live. Learning about artworks and why artists create art enable students to understand the experiences and concerns of people and communities, and in particular, connect with Singapore’s culture and history. Learning to formulate and express their own ideas and their responses to communities’ concerns deepens students’ understanding about themselves, and builds their bonds with Singapore and understanding of the wider world.

Art influences how we live<br>
Artistic thinking and visual elements and principles are used in many areas of our lives. The images we see, the things we use and the spaces we live in all require art in their construction and design. For example, the layout and design of rooms and spaces affect our moods and how we interact with other people. These in turn affect how we view and understand things and the world around us, the decisions we make and the activities we do. Learning how art is used in daily life heightens students’ critical awareness and equips them with knowledge and skills to communicate effectively and use art to enhance the quality of daily living.</td></tr>
