We offer 4-hour K1 and K2 programmes for children. You can choose from the following options:

*   Morning session (8am to 12pm)
    
*   Afternoon session (1pm to 5pm)
    

MOE Kindergarten follows _**MOE's calendar of school terms**_ and _**school holidays**_.

All MKs offer the same curriculum and programmes.

Each MK customises learning activities, teaching resources and approaches, and classroom spaces based on their children’s needs.
