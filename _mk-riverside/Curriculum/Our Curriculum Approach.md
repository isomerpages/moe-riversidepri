Our curriculum and programmes are based on the [Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework](https://www.moe.gov.sg/preschool/curriculum) that guides the development of kindergarten programmes in Singapore.

At MOE Kindergarten (MK), we believe preschool children are curious, active and competent learners. They’re keen to make sense of the world around them, and they learn best through active learning.

We strive to make learning authentic and relevant for your child through activities with a distinctive Singapore flavour. This helps nurture your child’s:

*   Confidence and social skills.
    
*   Literacy and numeracy skills.
    
*   Bilingualism in English and their Mother Tongue Language (i.e. Chinese, Malay and Tamil languages).
