In step with the approach to be a safe and health-promoting school, the school works closely with its canteen stallholders to ensure the adoption of hygienic food preparation methods, the provision of healthier food options and the sale of food at reasonable and affordable prices to pupils and staff.

### Healthy Meals in School Programme(HMSP)

Since the start of Term II in 2017, the school has implemented the Healthy Meals in School Programme (HMSP) by the Health Promotion Board (HPB). The HMSP seeks to promote healthy eating among pupils as part of the holistic development of our children. The canteen stallholders are selling set meals which include items from the four main groups, i.e. wholegrains, fruit, vegetables and meat (or others).

As part of promoting healthy living and the habit of drinking plain water among students, the school has no drinks stall in the school canteen. Students are to bring their water bottle every school day and refill the water bottle at the water coolers in the school.
