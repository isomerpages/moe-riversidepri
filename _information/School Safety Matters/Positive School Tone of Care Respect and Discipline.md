#### Responding to an Incident between Your Child and Another Student

<p>As children grow up together, they may be involved in incidents and there may be issues that cause unhappiness among one another. We would like to emphasise that should there be a disagreement between your child and another student, please do not approach or confront the other child. Please also do not approach the other student’s parents, as this may cause further misunderstanding and worry. Do contact your child’s Form Teacher to highlight the matter and let the school look into investigation and resolution.</p>
