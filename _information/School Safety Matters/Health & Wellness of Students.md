<ol>
<li>Remind your child to maintain high standards of personal hygiene at all times.</li>
<li>Before your child leaves for school, please check on his/her health and wellness. You can check his/her temperature and look out for flu-like symptoms. If your child is unwell, bring him/her to see a doctor. Ensure that he/she rests at home for the full duration of the medical certificate (MC) and recovers fully before returning to school.</li>
<li>Remind your child to bring a water bottle to school and fill the bottle at the water coolers, and that he/she is NOT to drink directly from the water coolers.</li>

<label for="accordion3"><h5 style="color:blue">Healthy Meals in School Programme</h5></label>
    <div>
<p>The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has been working closely with schools to promote healthy eating among pupils as part of the holistic development of our children. Since the start of Term II, our school has implemented the HMSP. The food stallholders are selling set meals which include food in the four main groups, i.e. wholegrains, fruit, vegetables and meat (or others). We would like to seek parents’ assistance to encourage your children to eat the vegetables and fruits that come with the set meal. The circular from HPB provides more information.</p>
