<ol>
<li>Remind your child to maintain high standards of personal hygiene at all times.</li>
<li>Before your child leaves for school, please check on his/her health and wellness. You can check his/her temperature and look out for flu-like symptoms. If your child is unwell, bring him/her to see a doctor. Ensure that he/she rests at home for the full duration of the medical certificate (MC) and recovers fully before returning to school.</li>
<li>Remind your child to bring a water bottle to school and fill the bottle at the water coolers, and that he/she is NOT to drink directly from the water coolers.</li>

	<ol>

<li>Ensure that the medication is clearly labelled with your child’s name and class.</li>
<li>Ensure that your child knows how to take the medication or use it on himself/herself.</li>

<label for="accordion3"><h5 style="color:blue">Healthy Meals in School Programme</h5></label>
    <div>
<p>The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has been working closely with schools to promote healthy eating among pupils as part of the holistic development of our children. Since the start of Term II, our school has implemented the HMSP. The food stallholders are selling set meals which include food in the four main groups, i.e. wholegrains, fruit, vegetables and meat (or others). We would like to seek parents’ assistance to encourage your children to eat the vegetables and fruits that come with the set meal. The circular from HPB provides more information.</p>

<label for="accordion4"><h5 style="color:blue">Midday Snack Break</h5></label>
    <div>
<p>The school has implemented the midday snack break since 9 January 2017. Riverians clearly appreciate and enjoy the snack break as it helps them to sustain their energy level till the end of the school day. Parents are reminded to prepare healthy snacks which are easy for their child to manage during the 10-minute snack break in the classroom. It would be helpful for pupils to have wet wipes with them to clean up after the snack break.

The following table indicates items that are acceptable and those that are not acceptable for the snack break.</p>

<label for="accordion5"><h5 style="color:blue">Specific Medical Condition and Prescribed Meditation</h5></label>
    <div>
<p>All students are to bring a working Oral Digital Thermometer to school on every school day.  Pupils are encouraged to use the thermometer to monitor their own health and check if they have fever.  This is to foster in pupils a sense of personal responsibility for their own health and wellbeing.<br>

During this COVID-19 period, students are required to take their temperature twice daily (once in the morning and once in the afternoon if they are staying back for afternoon activities).</p>

<label for="accordion6"><h5 style="color:blue">No-Frills Birthday Celebrations</h5></label>
    <div>
		
<p>We understand that some parents would like their child to celebrate his/her birthday with his/her classmates and teachers. We are happy to share that the Form Teacher and Co Form Teacher have simple and meaningful class practices to celebrate the children’s birthdays, e.g. class singing of the birthday song.<br>

To cultivate a culture of simplicity and appreciation as well as to promote a healthy lifestyle, we appeal to parents not to send birthday cakes, food items,tidbits, goodie bags and gift-packs for birthday celebrations in school. This is also to safeguard the safety of children (e.g. food allergies). We seek your understanding and cooperation for this.</p></div>
