   <p>We seek parents’ cooperation to effect the following measures to ensure your child’s personal health and wellness and to heighten his/her sense of social responsibility.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remind your child to maintain high standards of personal hygiene at all times.</li>
<li>Before your child leaves for school, please check on his/her health and wellness. You can check his/her temperature and look out for flu-like symptoms. If your child is unwell, bring him/her to see a doctor. Ensure that he/she rests at home for the full duration of the medical certificate (MC) and recovers fully before returning to school.</li>
<li>Remind your child to bring a water bottle to school and fill the bottle at the water coolers, and that he/she is NOT to drink directly from the water coolers.</li>
</ol>
