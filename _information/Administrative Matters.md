<li><b>How primary school fees are structured</b></li>

<p>Monthly fees in primary schools have 3 different components:</p>
<p>1.  <b>School fees</b>&nbsp;are set by MOE and go towards government revenue. These fees are different for&nbsp;Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents&nbsp;and international students.<br></p>
<p>2.  <b>Miscellaneous fees</b>&nbsp;are set by MOE but go towards individual schools’ budgets and operating expenses. The same rate applies to all students, regardless of nationality.</p>
