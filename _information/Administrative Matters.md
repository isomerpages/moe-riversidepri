<li><b>How primary school fees are structured</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Monthly fees in primary schools have 3 different components:</p>
<p>1.  <b>School fees</b>&nbsp;are set by MOE and go towards government revenue. These fees are different for&nbsp;Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents&nbsp;and international students.<br></p>
<p>2.  <b>Miscellaneous fees</b>&nbsp;are set by MOE but go towards individual schools’ budgets and operating expenses. The same rate applies to all students, regardless of nationality.</p>
<p>3.  <b>Second-tier miscellaneous fees</b>&nbsp;are set by the schools within a range determined by MOE, which is up to 100% of the standard miscellaneous fees. The fees go towards individual schools’ budgets and operating expenses. The same rate applies to all students, regardless of nationality.
<br></p>
<p>Singapore Citizens in primary schools may be eligible for financial assistance under the&nbsp;MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. Some students may also be eligible for&nbsp;merit-based awards and scholarships.</p>
