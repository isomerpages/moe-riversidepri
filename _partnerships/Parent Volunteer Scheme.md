### PHASE 2B PARENT VOLUNTEER SCHEME REGISTRATION
Dear Parent,

Thank you for your interest in applying as a Parent Volunteer (PV) under the Phase 2B Parent Volunteer Scheme. The objective of the Parent Volunteer Scheme is to encourage parents' long-term involvement with the school.

Under this scheme, a parent may be able to register his / her child under Phase 2B of the Primary One Registration Exercise if he / she meets the following criteria:
<br>a. His / Her child is a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident;
<br>b. He / She has joined the school as a parent volunteer and has contributed at least 40 hours of voluntary service to the school within the PV service period (1 May 2024 to 30 April 2025).

Application Eligibility and Period:
<br>a. Application for Phase 2B Parent Volunteer Scheme is now open for children (Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident) born between 2 Jan 2019 and 1 Jan 2020 (both dates inclusive). This is for children registering for Primary One in 2026.
<br>b. Application period: 6 January 2024 to 31 March 2024. Please note that incomplete and late application will not be considered.

Application Outcome Notification:&nbsp; There are 20 vacancies and in the event that there is an overwhelming number of applicants, a balloting exercise will be conducted. All applicants will be notified of the outcomes of registration via email by 12 April 2024.

PV Service Period:&nbsp; Service Period: 1 May 2024 to 30 April 2025 (To complete 40 hours of PV service by either one or both parents)

Please note that successful completion of the Parent Volunteer Scheme only accords the eligibility to register at Riverside Primary School under Phase 2B of the Primary One Registration Exercise. It does not guarantee your child of a place in the school and will be subjected to balloting should the number of applicants be greater than vacancies during Phase 2B Registration.
